                        <h2>The Idea</h2>
                        <em>January 16th, 2024</em>
                        <p>
                            This phase began with our recognition of the significant problem of waste management and the adverse effects of unmanaged waste on the environment. From initial rough ideas, we began researching and developing the concept of a smart trash bin.

                    </li>

                    <li data-date="28/02/2024">
                        <h2>Development starts</h2>
                        <em>February 28th, 2024</em>
                        <p>
                            Subsequently, through research and discussion, we identified the necessary features for a smart trash bin, including automatic waste sorting and notification when full. We spent time analyzing modern technologies such as sensors, machine learning, and IoT to apply them to creating an efficient operational system.

                        <p>
                            After outlining the basic concept, we started programming and testing the necessary software and hardware for the smart trash bin. Through iterative testing and refinement, we fine-tuned and perfected the product to ensure the highest stability and performance.

                        <p>
                            Simultaneously, we developed a user-facing website accessible to the public. This platform provided users with information about the smart trash bins, their locations, and guidelines for proper waste disposal. Users could also access real-time data on bin availability and capacity, enabling them to make informed decisions when disposing of their waste.

                        <p>
                            Finally, with the completed product, we integrated the smart trash bin into the scientific and technical project, aiming to provide practical benefits and solve the waste management problem effectively. Simultaneously, we also set the goal of developing and deploying widespread applications of this product, from urban areas to public spaces and industrial zones, to create a cleaner and more sustainable living environment.
